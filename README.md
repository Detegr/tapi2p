## tapi2p
OpenSSL learning project.
The ultimate goal is to create a secure f2f chat/file sharing network.

### Encryption
Encryption is done with OpenSSL. For authentication, 4096bit RSA-keypairs will be used. All data will be end-to-end encrypted with 256bit AES-cbc encryption.

### UI
There will be multiple UI's, including pure command line client, and a curses-based cli.

### OS support
Different from my other projects, this will mainly focus Linux only. Porting is possible but I'm personally not intrested in doing that.
